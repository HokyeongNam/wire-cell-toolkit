* Overview

A *point tree* refers to an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree][n-ary tree]] with *nodes* that hold a set of "local" *point clouds*.  A subset of the tree called a "scoped view" can be constructed.  The view is limited to certain nodes, a point cloud local to the nodes and a subset of arrays within those local point clouds.  On the points in the view a k-d tree may be constructed.  Each point in a set returned by a k-d tree query can be associated back to the node that provided it.

* What is a point cloud

A point cloud (here) is implemented by the class ~PointCloud::Dataset~.  In this context one may use the term "point cloud" and ~Dataset~ equivalently (and we introduce "selection" below which is also like a point cloud).

A ~Dataset~ is essentially a set of arrays implemented with the class ~PointCloud::Array~.  Each ~Array~ held by a ~Dataset~ by a "name" or a ~std::string~ key in a ~std::map~.  The ~Array~ instances are held by ~shared_ptr<Array>~ to avoid memory copies across the broader usage and to remove the need to worry about explicit memory management.

An ~Array~ owns a contiguous chunk of memory holding an array of elements (numbers).  The C++ type of the element (~double~, ~float~, ~size_t~, ~int~, etc) is expressed in a dynamic way.  That is, the ~Array~ class can hold elements of any type.  The C++ type can be restored via template ~Array~ methods.  This [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_erasure][type erasure]] allows ~Dataset~ to hold a heterogeneous collection of arrays.

An ~Array~ also holds its shape.  Eg, a 2D array may have shape ~(3,10)~.  That is, it has 3 rows and 10 columns.  For any dimensionality, the array has a "major axis size".  For example, a row-major 2D array of shape ~(3,10)~ has a "major axis size" of 10.

~Dataset~ assures that all its arrays have the "major axis size".  This allows an index along that axis to be interpreted as identifying a "point" with attributes.  If a ~Dataset~ has three arrays named "x", "y" and "z" then a point at a given major axis index has three attributes of the same name and with values as found at that index in each of the arrays.

Let's make such a ~Dataset~.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  TEST_CASE("point tree example simple point cloud")
  {
      Dataset pc({
          {"x", Array({1.0, 1.0, 1.0})},
          {"y", Array({2.0, 1.0, 3.0})},
          {"z", Array({1.0, 4.0, 1.0})}});
      
      // Each array is size 3 and thus the PC has that major axis size
      CHECK( pc.size_major() == 3 );
      
      // Accessing a single element in the PC takes two steps:
      // get the array by name, get the element by index.
      auto arr = pc.get("x");
      CHECK( arr );
      
      // We must supply a C++ type in order to extract a value.
      CHECK( arr->element<double>(0) == 1.0 );
#+end_src  
  
This last line requires special attention.  We must supply a C++ type to extract array values and this type must match the dynamic type of the array.  It is up to the programmers to know the types through contract / convention.

A ~Dataset~ can also yield a subset of its arrays in the form of a vector of shared pointers to the arrays called a *selection*.  The selection is defined by a list of array names and the order of that list determines the order of the arrays in the vector.  Here, we select "x", "y" and "z".

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
    Dataset::selection_t sel = pc.selection({"x","y","z"});

    // The selection must be the same size as the list of names.
    CHECK( sel.size() == 3 );

    // Get first array ("x") and the value at its index 0.
    CHECK( sel[0]->element<double>(0) == 1.0 );
#+end_src

In general, if not in this example, a selection is a subset of the ~Dataset~ arrays that are to be considered *coordinate points*.  A selection of coordinate points is essentially a point cloud with its arrays accessed by a dimension number instead of an array name and with some specific interpretations.  It represents points on coordinates axis that span some space (eg, 3D Cartesian space in this example) and which have the same numeric type (eg ~double~ or ~int~ but not a mix).  Below we will see how a selection is used to build a *k-d tree*.

A selection is still "row major" in that one must get the array for a dimension and then index to get the scalar element value.  A transpose can be effected by viewing a selection through a *coordinate array*.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
      // Defaults to point elements of type double
      coordinate_array ca(sel);
      CHECK( ca.ndims() == sel.size() );
  
      // Iterate over the selection, point by point.
      size_t count = 0;
      for (const auto& cpt : ca) {
          // Each cpt is a "column" down the rows of selected arrays.
          CHECK( cpt.size() == sel.size() );
          CHECK( cpt[0] == sel[0]->element(count) );
          ++count;
      }
  }
#+end_src

* What is a (n-ary) tree

  What is meant by a "tree" here.  Specifically what is an *n-ary tree*?  Most generally speaking an n-ary tree is a directed acyclic graph that allows for n-way splits but joins are not allowed.  This means  that there is a unique *path* from the singular *root node* to each of the other nodes in the graph (tree).

  In the implementation described here, there is no actual "tree" object per se.  Rather, we work only with nodes.  A node may have a *parent* node and a node may have zero or more *children* nodes.  A node with no parent is called the *root* node.  A root node may be considered the *representative* of its *tree*.  It is possible to navigate from any node to the root node and vice versa. 

  Children nodes are owned by a parent node in an ordered list of nodes.  Ownership is expressed by holding a child node in a ~std::unique_ptr~.  Since the ~unique_ptr<>~ is important, lets define a type for it.  The template argument will be described below.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
using node_ptr = std::unique_ptr<Points::node_t>;
#+end_src  

  Children in this list are called *sibling* nodes.  By default, the order of siblings in this list is determined by the order in which the child node was inserted to the list.  The ordering implies that a child may have a *left sibling* (an "older child") and may have a *right sibling* (a "younger child").  This ordering is reflected in the order that nodes are seen in a depth-first descent of the tree.

  A child may be inserted to or removed from a parent.  When removed, the caller is given ownership by accepting a ~node_ptr~ as the return value from the node's ~remove()~ method.  If the caller drops this ~node_ptr~ the child node and any descendant nodes it may hod are destructed.  In either case (insertion or removal) the parent node, its parent, etc up to the root node, can receive notification of the change.  The ordering of any of the child list may be changed by the user but this will not (currently) trigger such notification.

  A user of a tree need not worry about ~node_ptr~ except when ~remove()~ is invoked.  Most of the time the user will deal in bare pointers ~Points::node_t*~.  For example, accessing the children via ~children()~ returns a vector of bare pointers.  These are *lent pointers* and do not transfer ownership.  Ownership resides with the parent.  Transfer of owner ship from the tree to the caller is always done via the unique pointer ~node_ptr~.  OTOH, using ~insert()~ on either bare or unique pointer types transfers ownership to the tree.  In the case of ~insert()~ of a bare pointer, the pointer must be to heap and not stack memory.


* What is a node

  Generically a node here is of type ~WireCell::NaryTree::Node<ValueType>~.  The two types (node and value) are closely integrated.  The "node" knows about its "value" and vice versa.  This allows generic tree algorithms to operate on the "node side" while application-specific functionality can be provided by the "value side".

  For a *point tree*, the value type is the class ~WireCell::PointCloud::Tree::Points~.  This class provides the following application-specific features:

  - node-local point clouds
  - scoped point clouds
  - scoped k-d trees
  - callback methods to react to tree changes 
These features are described more below.

  Let's start by making a "node-free" ~Points~ instance with a single point cloud named "3d" that consists of three arrays named "x", "y" and "z".

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  TEST_CASE("point tree example nodeless points")
  {
      Points p( { {"3d", Dataset({
              {"x", Array({1.0, 1.0, 1.0})},
              {"y", Array({2.0, 1.0, 3.0})},
              {"z", Array({1.0, 4.0, 1.0})}}) } });
  
      // Normally, we can get the node that holds this value
      // but in this example that node does not exist.
      CHECK( p.node() == nullptr );
  
      // But we can access the local point clouds.
      auto& lpcs = p.local_pcs();
      CHECK( lpcs.size() == 1 );
      CHECK( lpcs.find("3d") != lpcs.end() );
  }
#+end_src

  The above test and others generated from this document can be run with these commands:

  To see logging output, assign an environment variable ~SPDLOG_LEVEL=debug~:
  #+begin_example
  $ SPDLOG_LEVEL=debug ./build/util/wcdoctest-util -tc='point tree example*'
  #+end_example
  
* A value with a node

  We can extend the previous example to put the value into a node, and thus make our first, if somewhat boring, tree.  Since the value knows the node type (and vice versa) and since we can construct the node with a value, this extension is simple and similar to the above example.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  TEST_CASE("point tree example single node")
  {
      // Normally, we would not create a node on the stack
      // as it could never be a child because as a child
      // must be held by unique_ptr.  
      Points::node_t n(Points( { {"3d", Dataset({
              {"x", Array({1.0, 1.0, 1.0})},
              {"y", Array({2.0, 1.0, 3.0})},
              {"z", Array({1.0, 4.0, 1.0})}}) } }));
  
      // The node directly exposes its value as a data member  
      Points& p = n.value;
  
      // And we can go full circle to get a pointer to the value's node.
      Points::node_t* nptr = p.node();
  
      // This time, that node must exist because we just made it
      CHECK( nptr == &n );
  }
#+end_src  
  
* A larger but simple tree

  So far, so boring.  Let us now make a larger but still fairly simple tree.  We will put this into a local function that returns a ~unique_ptr<>~ (~node_ptr~).  It makes use of a function ~make_janky_track()~ provided by ~PointTesting.h~ to generate some point cloud.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  static
  Points::node_ptr make_simple_pctree()
  {
      // We will return this unique pointer to node
      Points::node_ptr root = std::make_unique<Points::node_t>();
  
      // Insert first child with a set of named points clouds 
      // containing one point cloud build from a track.
      auto* n1 = root->insert(Points({ {"3d", make_janky_track()} }));
      REQUIRE(n1 != nullptr);
  
      // Insert a second child with a point cloud
      // from a different track.
      auto* n2 = root->insert(Points({ {"3d", make_janky_track(
                          Ray(Point(-1, 2, 3), Point(1, -2, -3)))} }));
      REQUIRE(n2 != nullptr);
  
      return root;
  }
#+end_src  
  
Note, we construct the ~Points~ value as part of the insert.  If possible, this will take ~std::move()~ semantics, otherwise a copy is suffered.  Internally, a new node is created and held in a ~std::unique_ptr~.  However, the *bare* pointer to this new node is returned.  This is not transferring ownership and the caller is free to ignore the pointer.  At some later time, a caller may also retrieve the child pointer with methods provided on the node side.

* Do simple things with this simple tree

With this simple tree we may show off some of the functionality.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
// Loop over children and dump info about them.
static void dump_children(const node_ptr& node)
{
    // Loop over children node "Points" values 
    for (const auto& cval : node->child_values()) {
        // The named point clouds held by this node value.
        const auto& pcs = cval.local_pcs();

        debug("child node at {} with {} local point clouds",
              (void*)cval.node(), pcs.size());

        // loop over the set of point clouds
        for (const auto& [name, pc] : pcs) {
            debug("\tchild has pc named \"{}\" with {} points",
                  name, pc.size_major());
        }
    }
}

TEST_CASE("point tree example simple tree operations")
{
    auto root = make_simple_pctree();
    dump_children(root);

    // Find iterator to first child in child list
    CHECK( root->nchildren() == 2 );
    auto cptr = root->children().front();

    // Remove it as a child and we get ownership as unique_ptr.
    auto cuptr = root->remove(cptr);
    CHECK( root->nchildren() == 1 );

    // We can add that orphaned child back.  This transfers ownership.
    auto* cptr2 = root->insert(std::move(cuptr));
    CHECK( root->nchildren() == 2 );

    // But, we caught the return and now have a loaned bare pointer
    CHECK( cptr2 );

    // We should now see the reverse order as above dump.
    dump_children(root);
}
#+end_src  
Running this test will produce output similar to the following which has some extraneous parts suppressed:

#+begin_example
$ SPDLOG_LEVEL=debug ./build/util/wcdoctest-util -tc="point tree example simple tree operations"
child node at 0x1f9f0a0 with 1 local point clouds
	child has pc named "3d" with 74 points
child node at 0x1fa00a0 with 1 local point clouds
	child has pc named "3d" with 74 points
child node at 0x1fa00a0 with 1 local point clouds
	child has pc named "3d" with 74 points
child node at 0x1f9f0a0 with 1 local point clouds
	child has pc named "3d" with 74 points
#+end_example



* Scope 

Before we may explore the ~Points~ API further, let's take a break and talk about *scopes*.  A *scope* defines the extent of a "view" on the point tree.  The scope extends from a given node and covers a *subset of arrays* in a *subset of point clouds* held in a *subset of nodes*.  A scope is then defined by the triplet of constraint values that define these subsets:

  1. a local point cloud name (~pcname~).
  2. a tree descent depth number (~depth~).
  3. a list array names (~coords~).

The scope then will cover all local point clouds with the given name that can be found from a depth-first search starting at the given node and limited by the descent depth number and that provide the list of array names.  The depth number gives the number of levels to descend.  A depth of 1 means only the starting node is considered, 2 includes the starting node and its children, 3 includes also the grand children, etc.  The special depth number of 0 means that there is no limit to the depth.

A scope is represented by the ~Scope~ class.  Here are some ways that it may be used.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  TEST_CASE("point tree example scope")
  {
      // A default scope can be constructed.
      // It is a null scope as it would match no local 
      // point cloud arrays despite having unlimited depth.
      Scope s;
      CHECK( s.pcname == "" );
      CHECK( s.coords.empty() );
      CHECK( s.depth == 0 );
  
      // Some non-empty scopes.  Note the case sensitivity.
      Scope s0{ "pcname", {"x","y","z"}, 0};
      Scope s1{ "pcname", {"x","y","z"}, 1};
      Scope s2{ "PCNAME", {"x","y","z"}, 0};
      Scope s3{ "pcname", {"X","Y","Z"}, 0};
      Scope sc{ "pcname", {"x","y","z"}, 0};
  
      // Scopes can be compared for equality
      CHECK( s0 == s0 );
      CHECK( s0 == sc );
      CHECK( s0 != s1 );
      CHECK( s0 != s2 );
      CHECK( s0 != s3 );
  
      // A scope has a std::hash().
      CHECK( s0.hash() == sc.hash() );
      CHECK( s0.hash() != s1.hash() );
      CHECK( s0.hash() != s2.hash() );
      CHECK( s0.hash() != s3.hash() );
  
      // So, it may be used as a key.
      std::unordered_map<Scope, size_t> m;
      m[s1] = 1;
      m[s2] = 2;
      CHECK( m[s0] == 0 );          // size_t default value
      CHECK( m[s1] == 1 );
      CHECK( m[s2] == 2 );
  
      // One can also print a scope
      debug("Here is a scope: {}", s0);
  }
#+end_src  

That ~debug()~ will show a line like:

#+begin_example
Here is a scope: <Scope "pcname" L0 x,y,z>
#+end_example


* Scoped view

The point tree will provide to the caller a *scoped view* object (~ScopedView~) that collects the information that from the point tree that is in a given scope.


#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  TEST_CASE("point tree example scoped point cloud")
  {
      auto root = make_simple_pctree();
  
      // Specify point cloud name and the arrays to select.  
      // We take the default depth number of 0.
      Scope scope{ "3d", {"x","y","z"} };
  
      // The corresponding scoped view. 
      auto const & sv = root->value.scoped_view(scope);
  
      CHECK(sv.npoints() > 0);
  }
#+end_src  

The ~scoped_view()~ method returns a ~ScopedView<double>~ by default.  The numeric template type must match the underlying type of the coordinates given by the scope.

A it is a *view*, the ~sv~ object lifetime can not be longer than that of the tree (~root~ node).  If a node is *inserted* to a viewed scope, that view will be *mutated* by appending to the view's contents.  On the other hand, if  a node is *removed* from a viewed scope then the view is *invalidated*.  The caller must retrieve the scoped view to get a valid view.

We now look at the major parts of the scoped view.

- vector of nodes
- vector of local PCs of the scope's ~pcname~ 
- vector of selections on these PCs with arrays named as given by the scope's ~coords~
- a k-d tree built on these selections

The three vectors have the same size and order.

* Scoped nodes

The *scoped nodes* are presented as a vector of pointers to nodes.  The vector is nominally in the order in which the nodes were encountered by the scoped depth-first descent.  In the case that additional in-scope nodes were added to a tree after the view was created they will appear appended to the scoped node vector.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  TEST_CASE("point tree example scoped nodes")
  {
      auto root = make_simple_pctree();
  
      Scope scope{ "3d", {"x","y","z"} };
      auto const & sv = root->value.scoped_view(scope);
  
      // Vector of pointers to n-ary tree nodes
      auto const& snodes = sv.nodes();
      CHECK(snodes.size() > 0);
      for (const auto& node : snodes) {
          const auto& lpcs = node->value.local_pcs();
          REQUIRE(node);
          CHECK(lpcs.find("3d") != lpcs.end());
      }
  }
#+end_src  

* Scoped point cloud

The *scoped point cloud* collects the *local point cloud* from each in-scope node that is named by the scope's ~pcname~.   The scoped point cloud is presented as a vector of references to the original point cloud and in the same order as the scoped node vector.  As the scoped point cloud keeps the individual local point clouds distinct it has the structure of an "array-of-array-of-points".  A ~disjoint_range~ may be used to iterate over the points in a scoped point cloud as if it were a flat collection of points (this type is described more below).  

Let's now make a scoped point cloud using the same simple tree introduced above.

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
    TEST_CASE("point tree example scoped nodes")
    {
        auto root = make_simple_pctree();
  
        Scope scope{ "3d", {"x","y","z"} };
        auto const & sv = root->value.scoped_view(scope);
  
        auto const& snodes = sv.nodes();
        auto const& spcs = sv.pcs();
        CHECK(spcs.size() == snodes.size());
  
        // A scoped point cloud is a vector of
        // references to node-local point clouds
        for (const Dataset& pc : spcs) {
            debug("pc {} arrays and {} points",
                  pc.size(), pc.size_major());
        }
  }
#+end_src  

* Interlude: disjoint range

A scoped point cloud is a collection of individual node-local point clouds.  We have some contradictory requirements in how we wish to use a scoped point cloud.  On the one hand, we wish to keep the individual node-local point clouds distinct as each node represents something (eg a "blob").  On the other hand, we wish to avoid making copies as point clouds can be rather large.  On the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gripping_Hand][gripping hand]], we wish to use a scoped point cloud as if it were contiguous.

The scoped point cloud structure satisfies the first two.  To provide a contigous view of a scoped point cloud we combine the already introduced coordinate range with a *disjoint range* that we introduce here.

A disjoint range allows for a "vector of vectors of elements" to look like a flat "vector of elements".  Below, will see it used internally in the interface to k-d trees, but here we will show how to use it directly.  

#+begin_src c++ :tangle doctest-pointtree-example.cxx
  #include "WireCellUtil/DisjointRange.h"
  TEST_CASE("point tree example scoped point cloud disjoint")
  {
      // As above.
      auto root = make_simple_pctree();
      auto spc = root->value.scoped_view(Scope{ "3d", {"x","y","z"} }).pcs();
  
      size_t npoints = 0;
      for (const Dataset& pc : spc) {
          npoints += pc.size_major();
      }
  
      // This part is a bit verbose, see text.
      // First we select a subset of arrays from each point cloud.
      std::vector<Dataset::selection_t> sels;
      for (Dataset& pc : spc) {
          sels.push_back(pc.selection({"x","y","z"}));

The central part of this example is rather verbose as we have to implement a few layers of conversion.  However, these layers are largely light-weight and involve iterators and do not copy any array data.  When used in the interface to k-d trees, these layers are hidden from the caller.

A note on performance.  One can iterate though a disjoint range at linear cost.  However, take care that while ~disjoint_range~ provides a random-access API its cost is not $\mathcal{O}(1)$.  True random access requires an ordered walk of a ~std::map~ to find the local point cloud followed by $\mathcal{O}(1)$ access of elements of its arrays.  To mitigate the cost of finding the local point cloud the ~disjoint_range~ will cache its last location.  This allows the walk to the next index to be shorter on average than if it were to start at the beginning of the map each time.  When the caller must perform many random accesses it is advised to do so with pre-ordered indices so that the relative walk of the map is minimized.  The absolute speed of this "random" access is greatly improved when compiling with ~-O2~.

And alternative element access mechanism is available for disjoint ranges.  It is true random access but exposes the disjoint nature.  This is shown by the use of the ~djind~ variable which is a pair of *major* and *minor* indices.  The major index selects an element of the "outer range" (eg, selects information from one node in scope) and the minor index selects an element of the "inner range" (eg, one point in the node-local point cloud).

* Scoped k-d tree

The scoped view also provides a *k-d tree* formed on the scoped point cloud.  Specifically, and for performance reasons, it concatenates the selected coordinate arrays into flattened copies.

A k-nearest-neighbor (knn) and radius search is implemented by the k-d tree interface.  Results of either query are in the form of a vector of a pair consisting of a point index and a distance.  *Attention* the distance is in the metric used.  In particularly, it is common to use an L2 metric and thus the "distance" is a measure of the *square* of a Cartesian distance.  Each point index may be used to recover a "major" and "minos" index.  The major index indicates from which node in the scoped view the point was provided and the minor index locates that point inside the node's local point cloud.

We will see some of this navigation below but lets first just exercise a k-d tree query.
