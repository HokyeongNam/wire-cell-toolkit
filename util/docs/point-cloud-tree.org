#+title: WCT Point Cloud Tree
#+include: ../../docs/include-topic.org

* Conceptual Overview

In WCT, a /point cloud tree/ (pctree) builds upon the N-ary tree (see
[[file:nary-tree.org]]) by providing a node value type that holds a set of /point
clouds/ (PCs, see [[file:point-cloud.org]]) that are referenced by key names.  The
value type also provides the ability to produce a facade.

The PCs of a given name held locally by a set of nodes may be
aggregated into a larger PC by requesting it by the same name through
an ancestor of the set of nodes.  This aggregation is performed in
depth-first order and may be limited to a particular *depth scope*.  The
depth scope counts levels of tree hierarchy starting at the node in
which the descent is initiated.  Thus a depth scope of unity refers to
just the "local" PCs of the given node.  A depth scope of two would
concatenate the PC from the starting node and the PCs from all direct
children of the starting node.  A depth scope with the special value
of zero represents unlimited descent.

A pctree node also provides a k-d tree query interface object built
upon any PC available through the node.  Once built, the k-d tree is
cached to accelerate future use.  The k-d tree query is parameterized
by the following information:

- the PC name
- its depth scope
- a list of attribute names used as coordinates


* Applications

The pctree data structure is designed with some generality but it is
specifically intended to represent a hierarchy relevant to WCT imaging
and pattern recognition:

#+begin_example
cluster group -> cluster -> sub-cluster -> blob
