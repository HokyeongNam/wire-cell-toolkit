#+title: Cluster Point Clouds
#+include: ../../docs/include-topic.org

* Overview

The ~ICluster~ is converted to a number of point clouds (PCs) as
provided for clustering and pattern recognition algorithms.

* Taxonomy

- group :: a set of clusters with some semantic meaning ("live", "dead")
- cluster :: a set of blobs with some mutual connectivity
- blob :: ("mcell" in WCP) a volume bound by a transverse polygon and a longitudinal extrusion (3D) and with projection in each view (3x2D)
- point :: an abstract element that asociates a coordinate in either 3D Cartesian or 2D view space with additional attributes
- pointcloud :: a collection of point attributes

* WCP

Clusters must provide methods for WCP.  PR3DCluster is main "cluster"

** Functions

*** Clustering live dead

- CN(A,B) -> {b} :: cluster neighbors, find the set of blobs {b} in
  cluster A that are "near" cluster B.

- PWCN(AA,BB) -> B:{(CN(A,B),AA)} ::  pair-wise cluster neighbors given
  cluster set AA and cluster set BB, find /cluster neighbors/ for all
  pairs (A,B), A in AA and B in BB.



** Cluster methods

- add blob (see below for blob info)

-   


** Blob

Region of extent in multiple spaces:

- on one face
- 2D transverse space bounded by wires (6 numbers)
- 1D longitudinal space bounded by three equivalent ranges: (time,dt), (tick,nticks), (x,dx)
- 3x2D projective space bounded by channels (wire-attachment-number) and ticks

  
* 

- a blob holds bounds and a PC of sampled points and attributes
- a cluster holds blobs
- blob can be added to / removed from cluster
- cluster maintains k-d caches of blob PCs

** names

- PCBCluster :: point cloud blob cluster
- BCluster :: blob cluster
- BlobCluster :: blob cluster
- ClusterPointCloud ::
- ClusterPC ::
