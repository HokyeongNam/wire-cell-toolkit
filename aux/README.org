#+title: Wire-Cell Toolkit Auxiliary 
#+include: ../docs/include-readme.org

* Overview

This core WCT package enjoys a special position in the dependency
tree.  It depends on ~WireCellIface~ as do other "implementation"
packages.  But, unlike the others that do not have any compile time
inter-dependencies, the other "implementation" packages may have
compile time dependency on ~WireCellAux~.

Some categories of code appropriate for ~aux~:

- general purpose implementation of ~IData~ interfaces (eg the ~Simple*~ classes)
- ~INode~ implementations that provide general purpose data converters (eg, ~ITensorSet <--> IFrame~)
- general utility code that operate on interfaces (eg, ~FrameTools~)
