* Introduction

The WCT configuration structure layers convention defines a Jsonnet
API to satisfy a few goals:

- Define a countable number of specific configurations for all
  supported detectors.

- Produce job configuration that is not directly dependent on details
  of any given detector variant.

- Facilitate extraction of the subset of configuration for a given
  detector while still providing a means of consolidating
  configuration that spans all supported detectors.

- Give end-user control over elements specific to a job and
  independent from a given detector variant.

- Allow to inject system "service" configuration.

It identifies these "layers":

- mains :: Integration with the application (~wire-cell~ CLI or
  art/LArSoft).

- high :: The *high-level API* is *detector independent* and is used to
  develop "main" Jsonnet structures to define some *job type*.

- mid :: The *middle-level API* is also *detector independent* while its
  implementation holds *detector-dependent* information.

- low :: The *low-level API* is *detector independent* and provides
  utilities to help make producing a mid-level API instance easier.

The sections below describe each layer in some details.

* Mains

The "mains" layer provides the "fringe" subgraph that adapts a "core"
graph to nodes that provide initial input and accept final output.

For example, a ~wire-cell~ command line job is configured with a
"fringe" of file I/O nodes that sources data to or sinks data from the
"core" subgraph that provides the processing.

Another example is an art/LArSoft job will have a "fringe" of nodes
that handle transfer and transformation of objects between the art
event store and the "core" WCT subgraph.


* High

The "high" layer API collects some general utilities such as
~wirecell.jsonnet~, ~pgraph.jsonnet~, helpers to construct components to
handle I/O, build a main graph.  It also provides a /factory method/ to
create a *mid-layer API* object.

A developer may use the *high-layer API*, and the returned *mid-layer API*
object to construct *detector-independent* main Jsonnet configs.

To construct a *mid-layer API object* the developer will typically have
Jsonnet defining a function taking top-level arguments (TLAs) like:

#+begin_src jsonnet
local high = import "layers/high.jsonnet";
function(detector, variant="nominal", options={sparse:true})
    local services = high.services(platform);
    local mid = high.mid(detector, variant, services=services, options=options);
#+end_src

The ~high.mid()~ factory takes these arguments and options:

- ~detector~ :: the canonical name of a detector (~"dsp"~, ~"uboone"~, etc)
- ~variant~ :: the canonical name of a detector variant (~"nominal"~, etc)
- ~services~ :: *optional* used to inject "service" type component config
  for ~IRandom~, ~IDFT~, etc.  As shown above, the default is simply made
  explicit.
- ~options~ :: see following comments.

** Options

The mid-layer API factory method allows the passing of an optional
~options~ object.  A mid-layer API *must* produce a valid API object if no
~options~ object is provided.  It *may* modify how it produces a mid-layer
API object based on the content of ~options~.  It *should* only enact
modifications based on ~options~ which are superficial to the meaning of
the detector variant.  It *should* support "standard options" as
described next.

The intention of ~options~ is to provide a means for an end-user to
communicate certain configuration required to match up the
configuration provided by the mid-layer API object with configuration
provided by some external code.  The following "standard options"
should be honored by the mid-layer API.

- ~sparse~ :: ...
- frames :: per frame / tier control of sparse...

* Mids

Each detector variant *must* implement one or more *mid layer API*
objects.  Each mid layer API object corresponds to a *variant* of the
supported *detector*.  The API object provides methods to construct
subgraphs covering a conceptual region of processing.  For example,
the ~sim.signal()~ method provides a subgraph to configure "signal
simulation".

** Mid-layer API

This describes the required API.  Some portions of the API are
provided as sub-objects described in following subsections.

- ~anodes()~ :: return an ordered list of configuration objects for the ~IAnodePlane~ instances.
- drifter(name="") :: return subgraph for drifting.  A ~name~ may be given if caller requires more than one drifter.
- ~sim.*~ :: the simulation sub-API.
- ~sigproc.*~ :: the signal processing sub-API.
- ~img(anode)~ :: return a subgraph to perform 3D imaging

*** The ~sim.*~ sub-API

The ~sim.*~ sub-API has the following methods:

- ~track_depos(tracklist=/*default*/)~ :: return subgraph to generate depos from list of (ideal) tracks.  Default value must provide some tracks in the detector.  The exact "kinematics" is not important and this is used as fodder to get "something" out of later simulation subgraphs 

- ~signal(anode)~ :: return subgraph to simulation depos to voltage level signals

- ~noise(anode)~ :: return subgraph to apply voltage level noise 

- ~digitizer(anode)~ :: return subgraph to digitize voltage to ADC.

*** The ~sigproc.*~ sub-API

The ~sigproc.*~ sub-API has the following methods:

- ~nf(anode)~ :: return subgraph to perform noise filtering
- ~sp(anode)~ :: return subgraph to perform signal processing
- ~dnnroi(anode)~ :: return subgraph to perform refined signal
  processing using DNN ROI inference.


* Low

The *low layer API* provides detector independent methods helpful in
constructing configuration objects returned by the *mid layer API*.


* Tutorial

The *high-layer API* has conceptually two sets of methods.

- methods to produce *detector-dependent* configuration objects by
  creating a *mid-layer API* object which presents a
  *detector-independent* interface.

- methods to produce configuration objects for data flow graph nodes
  which are *detector independent*.  For example, those which move data
  between some external context (file, art/larsoft) and the rest of
  the WCT data flow graph.

An "end user" sees only a *detector independent* interface,
parameterized by a *detector name* and a *detector variant name*.  A
developer for detector-specific configuration will only need develop
configuration code in the *mid layer API* directory and files specific
to their detector.

The following sections give a tutorial focused on how to develop the
*mid-layer API* objects.  Then sections cover use of the broader
*high-layer API*.


** Introduction to mid-layer

This tutorial will lead you through the process of developing a set of
*mid-layer API objects* for the ProtoDUNE-SP (~pdsp~) detector spanning a
few variants.

Each detector and detector variant must define a mid-layer API object.
This object contains methods (no data) which return WCT configuration
objects.  Every mid-layer API is identical, though of course each API
instance returns unique values.

** Running something

Assuming your ~WIRECELL_PATH~ includes the ~wire-cell-toolkit/cfg/~
directory and the WCT binaries are installed, the mid-layer code
covered by this tutorial can be exercised with:

#+begin_example
wcsonnet -A detector=pdsp layers/tut-high.jsonnet 
#+end_example

If you do not have WCT installed, you can use vanilla ~jsonnet~

#+begin_example
jsonnet \
  -J /path/to/wire-cell-toolkit/cfg \
  -A detector=pdsp \
  /path/to/wire-cell-toolkit/cfg/layers/tut-high.jsonnet
#+end_example

Before continuing, read through the [[file:tut-high.jsonnet]] with some focus
on how the ~mid~ object is created and then used.  The tutorial will
describe how to develop Jsonnet code to provide that ~mid~ object in its
proper form.

** Create mid-layer directories

Make the source directory named after the detector:

#+begin_example
mkdir -p cfg/layers/mids/pdsp/
cd cfg/layers/mids/pdsp/
mkdir api variants
#+end_example

** Variant parameters objects

For our ~pdsp~ example we start with a single ~nominal~ variant parameter
object defined in:

#+begin_example
variants/nominal.jsonnet
#+end_example

We can compile it directly:

#+begin_example
wcsonnet layers/mids/pdsp/variants/nominal.jsonnet
#+end_example

What goes in this object is up to you but following some conventions
we can make all our variant parameter objects have a common structure
and that structure will be convenient to reduce the amount of code we
must write in the mid-layer API factory.  As you develop that API it
is natural to make adjustments to the structure of the variant
parameter objects.

** Mid-layer API factory

The job of the mid-layer API factory is to produce mid-layer API
objects.  The entry point to that code must be in a detector-specific
directory.  For our ~pdsp~ example, it is here:

#+begin_example
cfg/layers/mids/pdsp/mids.jsonnet
#+end_example

It is short enough we include it here:

#+include: mids/pdsp/mids.jsonnet src jsonnet

Each detector will customize the ~variants~ object defined locally so
that it spans all known variants.  It may be extended by having one
~variant/<name>.jsonnet~ per variant and having each ~import~'ed.  Or
something else may be invented.

Whatever that be, this ~mids.jsonnet~ must produce a
~function(services,variants)~ that returns the appropriate mid-level API
object matching the variant.

In this example we see the ~api.jsonnet~ being imported.  This is the
API factory which is parameterized by ~services~ and the ~variant~
parameter object.

** Services

The ~services~ object holds configuration which is determined by the end
user and not the developer of the mid-layer API.  However, the latter
must know the (future) end user's decision before the mid-layer API
can be written.  And, so the mid-layer API requires the ~services~
object (dependency injection).

** Mid-layer API construction

Now, we visit

#+begin_example
cfg/layers/mids/pdsp/api.jsonnet
#+end_example

This function is what actually constructs the mid-layer API for ~pdsp~
variants.  It returns an object with methods (and not data) that
matches the mid-layer API.  To keep the body brief, the definition of
each API method is mostly delegated to other code.

Here we see the synergy made by structuring the variant parameter
object such that we may call the low-layer API (~low~ object here).


** Testing

As we bring "official" configuration for ~pdsp~ into a mid-layer
variants it is very important to test that we get back the same
result.  We may compile "old" and "new" and use ~diff~ like tools.

This can uncover "cosmetic" differences.  For example, the exact
instance names do not matter and one goal of the new config is to keep
them as brief as possible.  There can be order differences, for
example due to using a more efficient manner of processing the variant
parameter object.

There are tests collected in the ~test/~ directory.  For example:

#+begin_example
./test/test-tut-high.sh
#+end_example

This needs ~jq~ and ~gron~ installed and it will show a "flat-json-diff"
output

* Implementation requirements

These requirements a stated as a substitute for Jsonnet's lack of
language features to enforce conventions.

This section is written in the "must/shall" and "may/should" type
language of RFC 2119.  It describes rules that must be followed when
developing the configuration structure layers.

** General

Files found under ~cfg/layers/~ shall be considered part of the
configuration structure layers (or "layers" for short).

A layer file shall not import code from outside of the layers with the
exception of files found at ~cfg/*.jsonnet~.


** High

All files matching ~layers/*.jsonnet~ shall compose the "high" layer
implementation.

The high layer shall not define nor directly import any
detector-specific code.  Note: the generated file ~layers/mids.jsonnet~
imports all ~mids/<detector>/mids.jsonnet~ files but the imported code
presents a detector-independent API.

The high layer shall not directly import files from ~low/~.

** Mids

All files matching ~layers/mids/*/*.jsonnet~ shall compose
the "mid" layer.

A mid layer shall provide a file located to define its canonical
detector name:

#+begin_example
layers/mids/<detector>/mids.jsonnet
#+end_example

This file must produce a top-level function with signature and return
type:

#+begin_src jsonnet
  function(services, variant="nominal") {
      // mid API methods
  }
#+end_src

A mid implementation should be in terms of the "low" layer API
provided under ~low/~ and otherwise should avoid importing and using
code that resides outside of its ~<detector>/~ directory.

A mid implementation:

- must include a ~"nominal"~ variant.
- must include ~"real"~ and ~"fake"~ variants if the otherwise ~"nominal"~ variant must be distinguished between configuration for processing data from the real detector or from simulation, respectively.
- may define additional variants.

A mid implementation may extend the ~low.params~ object for each variant.

** Low

All files found under ~low/~ f compose the "low" layer.

The low layer code shall import no code from high nor mid layers.

The low layer code shall neither provide nor import any detector
specific code.

The low layer API method arguments shall not require detector-specific
structure.

The complexity of low method arguments should be managed to balanced
reduced structural complexity with increased argument count.
Non-scalar structured values may only be passed if their structure
opaque to the method or represents a portion of the canonical
~low.params~ structure.
