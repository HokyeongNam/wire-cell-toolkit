#+title: Wire-Cell Gen
#+include: ../docs/include-readme.org

This is the Wire-Cell "gen" sub-package.  It provides components
related to generating simulated data.  In particular:

- simple ionization deposition (depos) generators,
- drifting depos in the bulk volume of the detector,
- diffusion of these charges as they drift,
- convolution of drifted ionization with detector responses
- sampling fluctuations,
- intrinsic and coherent noise simulation
- ADC waveform digitization. of charge on the wire planes.

What follows are various, non-exhaustive notes on parts of the
sub-package.
