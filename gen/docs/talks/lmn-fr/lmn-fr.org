* Overview

We want to test LMN resampling on realistic waveforms 

- Need "full simulation" but want to avoid new field calculations.
- Apply LMN resampling to existing field responses (FRs):

|   <r> |            <r> |          <r> |      <r> |
|       | Field response |   simulation |      ADC |
|       |       sampling | downsampling | sampling |
|-------+----------------+--------------+----------|
| have: |  \qty{100}{ns} |     \times 5 |   500 ns |
| want: |   \qty{64}{ns} |     \times 8 |   512 ns |


- Understand FR related units and normalization.

- PDSP FR issues

- Apply to resampled FR in WCT simulation


* Sampling interpretation and resampling normalization $N_s \to N_r$

** Instantaneous

Samples are continuous function values, resampling is *interpolation*, signal strength preserved.

- Norm: $A_0 = \frac{N_r}{N_s}$ (normalizing on forward $DFT$ is correct)

** Integrating

Samples integrate continuous function over sample period, signal sum preserved.

- Norm: $A_1 = \frac{N_s}{N_r}A_0 = 1$ (normalizing on inverse $DFT^{-1}$ is correct)

** Energy

Samples provide "probability amplitude" or "field" values, signal Parseval energy (sum of squares) is preserved.

- Norm: $A_2 = \sqrt{\frac{N_r}{N_s}}$ (symmetric $DFT$ normalization is correct)

** Initial discussion details are in the paper draft.


* Resampling current field response ($I$)

We interpret $I$ as an *instantaneous electric current*.

- \small Resampling is an *interpolation*.
- \small Normalize the DFT round trip by the *initial size*.


** Note, all frequency spectra here are $|DFT(x)|$ with no normalization applied.

* Zoom in - time-domain ringing

*Small ringing* in the time-domain.
- \small Due to non-zero power at the original Nyquist frequency (\qty{5}{MHz}).
- Indicates the $I$ is *undersampled* at the original \qty{100}{ns}.
- The eventual convolution with the slower *electronics response* attenuates the ringing.
- Note, frequency-domain wiggles are actual features, not ringing.

** *We must be cognizant of ringing when applying LMN to ADC waveforms.*

* Cold electronics response ($E$)

$E$ is an *instantaneous* signal.

- \small Gain sets peak value and must be retained by the resampling.

We say *detector response* is $I \otimes E$.

- \small Naively, we get "weird units" which are not $[voltage]$.
- \small The sim multiplies by the sample period to give the missing $[time]$.

What normalization is correct?
- \small Do we resample before we convolve or vice versa?

* Charge field response resampling

We should have defined detector response as: \[I \to Q = I \cdot  T\]
Resampling $Q$ requires an *integral interpretation*.
- \small Time-domain samples are scaled to preserve total integral.
- Trivially,
  
\small  $[charge]\cdot[voltage/charge]=[voltage]$.

* Detector voltage response ($Q \otimes E$)


**                                                                :B_columns:

Normalization is now clear.
- \small $Q$ is integral-resampled.
- \small $E$ is interpolated-resampled.
- \small $V$ is (effectively) interpolated-resampled.
WCT ~Digitizer~ component will then produce interpolated ADC.


* PDSP FR issue: sample period not exactly \qty{100}{ns}

The file ~dune-garfield-1d565.json.bz2~ seems to be current ProtoDUNE-SP
- \small Is it still best?

It has $T=\qty{99.998998998999}{ns}$ which fails LMN "rationality condition".
- \small This is not FP round-off or JSON munging (100.0 is exact in JSON).
- \small For here/now, *force* $T = \qty{100}{ns}$.

Already mentioned that our FRs are in general *undersampled*.

* PDSP FR issue: time domain is too short


**                                                                :B_columns:

Early response is ignored.

- \small FR starts low with a down step.
- Non-zero DC component.
- (ringing in the resampled).

Note, FR sign opposite from ADC.
- \small Induction has positive net signal.
- $\sum Q / \sum |Q| \approx \qty{0.3}{\%}$

\scriptsize This problem was recently "discovered" by UVCGAN.

* WCT ~DepoTransform~ simulation

Folds multiple responses:
- field, electronics and RC (or RCRC).
- *downsamples* in time domain from ~fr.period~ to ~tick~.
Should naturally handle \qty{64}{ns} FR.

* TODO

- [ ] write 64ns FR file
- [ ] "diagonal" track sim with 512ns and 500ns ADC
- [ ] resample 512ns to 500ns and compare to native 500ns
- [ ] sigproc on resampled-500ns and native-500ns
