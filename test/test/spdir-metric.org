#+title: The SP directional metric test
#+setupfile: ../../docs/setup-topic.org

* Overview

The full "spdir-metric" test runs the following chain:

  1) *Generate* ideal line tracks at different angles in the detector volume. (~wirecell-*~)
  2) *Simulate* noise and ADC waveform from the tracks. (~wire-cell~)
  3) *Translate* apply an optional ADC waveform transform. (external)
  4) *Filter* apply WCT noise filtering. (~wire-cell~)
  5) *Signals* apply WCT signal processing. (~wire-cell~)
  6) *Metrics* for each track, calculate and output the metrics. (~wirecell-*~)
  7) *Plots* consume all metrics and make standardized plots. (~wirecell-*~)

Comments:

- The main command used to execute each step is given in parenthesis.

- The *translate* step is supported by the infrastructure for this test but is exercised outside the scope of WCT testing.  With no translate stage, *simulate*, *filter* and *signals* stages can be run in a single call to ~wire-cell~.

- The output of the *metrics* stage will be stored into the WCT test data repository to allow for historical tests.

The org content may also be /tangled/ with ~C-c C-v t~ to produce the individual BATS test files which of which executes the stages for a given supported detector.

* The WCT configuration

A single top level ~wire-cell~ configuration file configures how to run the *simulate*, *filter* and *signals* stages.  It requires specifying the detector, input and output file names and optional list of tasks.  Eg,

#+begin_example
wire-cell \
  -A detector=pdsp \
  -A input=depos.npz \
  -A output=sig.npz \
  test/test/spdir-metric.jsonnet 
#+end_example
