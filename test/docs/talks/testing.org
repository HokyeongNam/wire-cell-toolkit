Right?

\vfill

But, what does that mean?

- "Ad-hoc testing" /vs/ a "testing system".

- Why (and how) should I use a "testing system"?

* Ad-hoc testing and its problems                                :motivation:

We often invent our own /ad-hoc/ testing methods that look something like:

- Develop expert ~main()~ programs.
  - May have complex command line arguments or inputs.
  - Continually modify them as we develop the software. 
- Write simple or complicated shell scripts.
  - May work only on our own computer or account.
- Do not expect others to use them.
  - May have unwritten rules/assumptions.
- May release untested and buggy code to be found by others.
- Fix the bug, unknowingly add new bugs, re-add old bugs.
  - May not keep our ad-hoc tests around, or they may no longer check for old bugs.

* Why a testing "system"                                                :motivation:


#+begin_center
\Huge Assure code is correct by making it easy to develop and evaluate its tests.
#+end_center


* Requirements and goals for a testing system                    :motivation:

- All tests must be easy to run by all users and developers.
  - Expert knowledge is not required to run tests
- Automates test running to enable frequent testing.
  - Find and fix problems quickly.
- Provides drivers for development and bug fixing.
  - Help simplify development process while generating tests as side-effect.
  - Fix a bug exactly once, test forever (no regressions).
- Provides a common "language" in which we may discuss testing itself.
  - "Test ABC failed, please take a look".
- Allow tests to compare results between software versions.
  - Any change may be a regression or intentional, once change is found, categorizing is easy.
- Allow rich test output (plots, data files, logs).
  - Reduce human time to triage problems.
- Allows tests to have sufficient code coverage to assure refactoring does no harm.


* WCT Testing System Overview                                           :overview:

We may provide testing code at different "scales" or "levels".  From low to high:

- library :: checks that may throw *exceptions* in our libraries.
- unit :: checks and assertions defined outside of our libraries. 
- programs :: a full C++ ~main()~ or a script performing multiple checks.
- groups :: a set of test programs run together for a particular testing goal.
- suite :: all tests can be run automatically.

* What testing scale is right for me?

Two answers: "all of them" and "it depends".

\vfill

- To develop library code: *use exceptions*.
- To test individual functions or maybe a whole class: *use unit tests*.
- To test many classes together: *use test program*.
- To produce history data, plots and reports: *use test groups*.
- To make releases or just test everything: *use test suite*.

\vfill

The rest of this presentation gives a lot of detail about each. 

* Exceptions for library-level testing                           :exceptions:

#+begin_center
\Huge Use *exceptions* to test code right inside our libraries.
#+end_center

* What are C++ exceptions                                               :exceptions:

- A C++ *exception* is an instance of a type (usually a ~class~).

- A called function may (or may not) *throw* an exception to signal that an error has occurred.

- Any caller may *catch* an exception *by its type* in order to handle the error.


* The life cycle of an exception                                 :exceptions:

- Some running code *throws* an exception of some *type*.
- A search for a *type-matched catch* begins.
  - Start from the initial code context, then traverse the *call stack* toward ~main()~.
- If a match is found continue execution from the *catch code block*.
- If no match is found, process *exits with error status code*.


* Why are exceptions good (compared to returning "error" values)? :exceptions:

- Exceptions *can not be ignored*, return values are often ignored.
  - C++ provides ~[[nodiscard]]~ which helps to not ignore return values.
- Exceptions *imply meaning* through their type.
  - Return values require inventing /ad-hoc/ interpretations for good/bad values.
  - ~main()~ must return ~int~, always follow Unix standard: *zero is success*, non-zero is error.
- Exceptions *carry human-oriented messages* through their ~what()~ string
  - WCT exceptions add *traceback* information.
- Direct caller may not be able to handle error, but a (grand)parent caller may.
  - With return value we must complicate all code with "error forwarding".

* Why are exceptions bad (they are not)                                 :exceptions:

Exceptions are slow!
- No: modern compilers add essentially no overhead when supporting exceptions.
- Okay, a ~throw~ is marginally slower than a ~return~ but it is called ... *exceptionally*.

Exceptions cause programs to crash!
- Good: better to halt a program than to ignore return error codes or allow ~segfault~, etc.
- Good: helps developers find ignored errors quickly.

Exceptions are hard to program!
- Meh: a ~throw~ is slightly more code than a ~return~.
- Meh: a ~catch~ is slightly more than an ~if() {}~ check on a return value.

* When to throw an exception                                            :exceptions:

#+begin_quote
Throw an exception anytime an assumption is found to be violated.
#+end_quote

** Assumptions are ultimately specification of a data domain

- A function argument passes a value that outside an allowed/expected range.

- A return value is formed that is outside of the function range.

- An intermediate value is formed which for which the code can not further process.

- A configuration object is missing an expected attribute or has the wrong type of value.

- A file that is being parsed violates the expected schema.

- An inconsistency in code logic is encountered.
  
** But, sometimes we may "fix" a bad value instead of throwing an exception

- Can we cast? ~float x = cfg.asFloat(cfg["given_an_int"])~
- Can we coerce? ~std::clamp(val,lo,hi)~?

* What type of exception to throw                                       :exceptions:

WCT defines a small subset similar to standard C++/Python exception types.
\vfill

~#include "WireCellUtil/Exceptions.h"~

\vfill

- ~ValueError~ when a value is found to be outside its expected domain (*most common!*).
  - ~IndexError~ the domain is that of some lookup index.
  - ~KeyError~ the domain is that of some lookup key.
- ~RuntimeError~ due to external events and/or hard to reproduce.
- ~LogicError~ local preconditions or internal assumptions violated.
- ~IOError~ error with an external resource (file, network).

* How to throw an exception                                             :exceptions:

** Standard way

Can use C++ ~throw~ keyword, but better info when using WCT helpers.

** Old way - a little verbose

#+begin_example
  THROW(ValueError() << errmsg{"some message and " + a_string});
#+end_example

** New way - more succinct with ~printf()~ format codes

#+begin_example
  raise<ValueError>("some message and %s", a_string);
#+end_example


\footnotesize
- This is a new feature first in the ~apply-pointcloud~ branch.
- Mistakes with format codes will themselves throw exceptions. 

* When to catch an exception                                            :exceptions:

- *Always catch* an exception that your code *can handle*.

- *Never catch* an exception that your code *can not handle*.


\vfill
Some rare, special cases:
- May *catch and rethrow* to log info from the calling context but otherwise not handle.
- Convert exception (or return value) types at API boundaries.



* How to catch an exception

#+begin_example
try {  function_that_may_throw(); }
catch (const KeyError& e)   { handle_key_error(); }
catch (const IndexError& e) { handle_index_error(); }
catch (const Exception& e)  { handle_base_error(); }
catch (...)                 { handle_unknown_error(); }
#+end_example

* Exception code example                                                :exceptions:

\footnotesize
#+begin_src c++
  void do_something(const std::string& something) {
      if (is_bad(something)) {
          THROW(ValueError() << errmsg{"given something bad"});
      }
  }
  void func(size_t index) {
      auto thing = translate_command(index);
      do_something(thing);
  }
  void another_func() {
      size_t index = calculate_index();
      try {
          func(index);
      }
      catch (const ValueError& err) {
          std::cerr << "I did a bad thing\n";
      }
  }
#+end_src


* Unit tests

\Huge
#+begin_center
Use *unit tests* for brief, focused assertions.
#+end_center

* What are unit tests and unit test frameworks

** Unit test

A test of a small chunk (unit) of library code with a small chunk of test code.

** Unit test framework

A way to develop unit tests in an organized way that allows fast, comprehensive and/or targeted running.

* WCT supports ~doctest~ unit tests for C++

General features and usage motivations:

- Provides per-package ~main()~ and many useful CPP macros.
- Defines how to write tests, limiting but simplifying.
- Helps to easily develop and execute many "small" tests.
- "Light weight" dependency: a single header file added to WCT.
- Fits well into WCT's ~wcb~ build-based test running.

#+begin_center
\Huge Mini-tutorial on doctest
#+end_center




* doctest - overview

With [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest][doctest]]:

- We write one or more independent C++ files at: ~<pkg>/test/doctest*.cxx~.
  - Each file has one or more *small code snippets* or "test cases".
- We build the software as normal (~./wcb --tests~).
  - Also automatically runs the ~doctest~ programs.
- We give notice to any failures reported.
  - May manually re-run failed ~doctest~ program to dig into the problem.

* doctest - source file

** Location

#+begin_example
wire-cell-toolkit/<pkg>/test/doctest[_-]<name>.cxx
#+end_example

** How to pick ~<pkg>~

- Use the package holding the code you want to test.

- Use a package providing dependencies needed for the test.

** See also

WCT dependency graph: \scriptsize

https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/blob/master/wct-deps.png

* doctest - file boilerplate

#+begin_example
// in mypkg/test/doctest-mytest.cxx

#include "WireCellUtil/doctest.h"
#+end_example

\vfill

Besides actual test code and headers it needs, that's it!


* doctest - test case boilerplate

** Define a "test case" with a free-form name as a string:

#+begin_example
TEST_CASE("my first test") {
    // body of the test with assertions
}
#+end_example

** Notes

- The ~TEST_CASE("...")~ is a CPP macro but think of as declaring a function of the given free-form name
- The name can be used later to select the test with the command line program.

* doctest - assertions

** A test case should *assert* as many *expected values* as possible

#+begin_example
WARN(today == "weekend");      // only print a warning if false
CHECK(1 + 1 == 2);             // does not halt testing
REQUIRE(false == true);        // halts testing
CHECK_EQ( 1 + 1, 2 );
CHECK_FALSE( 1 + 1 = 3 );
CHECK(3.14 == doctest::Approx(22.0/7).epsilon(0.01));
CHECK_MESSAGE(x == 42, "do not know the answer");
REQUIRE(version == doctest::Contains("0."));
CHECK_THROWS_AS(func(), ValueError);
#+end_example

** Notes

See more in doctest's [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/assertions.md][assertions doc]].

* doctest - logging

** doctest provides built-in logging

#+begin_example
INFO("A message string ", 42, " ", stringifiable_object);
CAPTURE(some_variable);  // INFO() with var name + value
WARN(false);             // will cause above to output to log
FAIL("this wil abort");  // also triggers log output
#+end_example

** Notes
- Log output is triggered by a failed assertion or a ~WARN()~.
- Stringification is lazy, will log value at time of failed assertion.
  - More details in [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/logging.md][doctest logging doc]].
- To see WCT/spdlog messages, set env. var. ~SPDLOG_LEVEL=debug~.

* doctest - subcase

** A code scope that shares its own copy of the outer context

\scriptsize
#+begin_example
TEST_CASE("my first test") {
    bool ok=true;
    SUBCASE("a test using above as existing context") {
        ok = false;
        CHECK(!ok);
    }
    SUBCASE("another test using copy of the context") {
        // subcase above does not change our 'ok' variable
        CHECK(ok);
    }
}
#+end_example

** Notes
\footnotesize
- Changing an outer value (/eg/ ~ok~) in one ~SUBCASE()~ does not affect the value in another ~SUBCASE()~.
- Can nest ~SUBCASE()~'s.   More info in doctest's [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/testcases.md][test cases doc]].

* doctest - expert level

- [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/testcases.md#test-fixtures][Test fixtures]] are user-provided base classes that a test inherits.
- [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/testcases.md#test-suites][Test suites]] allow running a subset of tests via a filter.
- [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/testcases.md#decorators][Test decorators]] set attributes such as skipping, failure expectations, run time limits.




* doctest - build and run

#+begin_example
./wcb --target=wcdoctest-util   # build (and run)
wcdoctest-util                  # run all tests
wcdoctest-util -ltc             # list available test cases
                                # run a specific test case
wcdoctest-util --test-case="test some pca methods"
wcdoctest-util -d               # include duration timing
wcdoctest-util -h               # help for the many options
#+end_example



* 

\Huge
#+begin_center
Use *test programs* for larger, single-test executables and/or to fit into *test groups*.
#+end_center

* WCT test programs

Any program is a WCT test program if:

- All command line arguments are *optional*.
- It returns *nonzero error status code* from ~main()~ if a test fails and *zero on success*.
- It is written in a supported language (C++, bash, others).
- It follows WCT *test group source file naming* convention.
- It neither consumes nor produces files that are tracked as build dependencies.
  - It may consume/produce untracked files and consume files implicitly available from the build.

Types of WCT test programs:
- ~doctest-<pkg>~ set of C++ unit tests for one package collected into a ~main()~ program.
- ~test*.cxx~ a C++ ~main()~ test program written with no unit test framework.
- ~test*.bats~ a Bash shell unit tests run as a full program.
  
* 


#+begin_center
\Huge
Use test programs as development drivers.
#+end_center

* Test programs as vehicles for development

We all naturally write some kind of /ad-hoc/ program to *drive software development*.

- With slightly more attention, the driver can also serve as a test.

- If you need more than one test program, no problem, go for it.

- Want command line options?  That's okay! (see variants).

- Need to run many programs or post-process program output?  Great!
  Make a test script (see BATS coming up).



* WCT test groups organize test programs for unique purposes

** Build system executes one group at a time in order:

- check :: build system will only compile and not (directly) execute.
- atomic :: basic tests that do not depend on the execution of any other test.  
- history :: produce and save out files to the *test data repository* for future use.
- report :: produce summary material for human inspection.

Inside group, test programs may execute in parallel.


** Notes:
- Group is determined by source file name (see next).
- Each group may consume files or use programs from a prior group.
- The ~wcdoctest-<pkg>~ programs are considered in the *atomic* group.



* WCT test program source filename pattern

#+begin_center
~<pkg>/test/<prefix><sep><name>.<ext>~
#+end_center

- ~<pkg>~ names the sub package directory name, eg ~util~.
- ~<prefix>~ names the test *group* or an alias for a group,
  - *test* is an alias for *atomic*
- ~<sep>~ cosmetic, optional separator, may be an underscore ("~_~") or hyphen ("=~=").
- ~<name>~ brief, unique name to describe the assertion that is tested.
- ~<ext>~ defines how the test should be dispatched (compiled or interpreted).
  - Supported exentions: ~.cxx~, ~.bats~, ~.jsonnet~, ~.py~, ~.sh~ and ~.kokkos~.
  - We will focus only on C++ and bash/BATS in later slides.
  
** Examples

~util/test/test_array.cxx~

~test/test/history-comp1d.bats~

* Aside: variant tests

- WCT tests *shall not require* command line arguments (atomic).
- WCT tests *may accept fully optional* arguments (variant).

Variant tests can be useful to re-use testing code for novel tests.

Atomic tests can be made from variant tests by "baking" command line options in a test script:

\scriptsize
#+begin_example
./build/aux/test_idft                     # called atomically, actually a variant
./build/aux/test_idft FftwDFT WireCellAux # these are the default arguments

./build/aux/test_idft cuFftDFT WireCellCuda
cuda/test/test_idft_cufftdft.bats         # bakes args for CUDA, lives in cuda/

./build/aux/test_idft TorchDFT WireCellPytorch
pytorch/test/test_idft_torchdft.bats      # etc for PyTorch
#+end_example  

More on BATS tests later.



* WCT C++ test programs

Not much to it
- Follow all the rules for any WCT test program (see above).
- Provide the entire ~main()~.


* Testing helpers from WCT "util" library

Some ~#include "WireCellUtil/*.h"~ headers:

- ~Testing.h~ provides ~Assert(bool)~ and ~AssertMsg(bool,string)~
- ~TimeKeeper.h~ provides a "stopwatch" for lapped timing.
- ~MemUsage~ provides ways to track memory usage.

* Aside: more and high-level helpers are needed!

A number of operations are tedious to "bootstrap" in C++ testing code

- Generate or load wires geometry.
- Make ~IAnodePlane~ for some detector.
- Call things handled by ~Main~ plugin loading, factory, configuration.
- Construct and execute small data-flow graph.

Want to take some time to develop "helpers" to reduce tedium.
- Some "helpers" are local in ~test/*.cxx~ but should move to libraries.
- Need some "canned" configuration so tests can simply ask:
  - Give me anodes for detector "XYZ".

* What is software testing?

\Large
#+begin_quote
Executing the software in a way that asserts expected behavior.
#+end_quote

* What is testing software?

- A "test" is software that exercises the software under test.

- A "test" must *assert* expected behavior.
  - It must be possible to fail or it is not a test. 

- A "test" must require no special knowledge to run.

- A "test" may be defined on a *spectrum* of code scale:

  - a code fragment inside the software,

  - a single program exercising the software,

  - multiple, inter-dependent programs,

  - a "suite" consisting of many of the above.

WCT provides a testing system that hits on all these qualities.


* Categories of testing


\scriptsize
-    Acceptance :: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.
-    Integration :: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
-    Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
-    Functional :: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.
-    Performance :: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.
-    Regression :: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.
-    Stress :: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.
-    Usability :: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.
