* The WCT test data repository

Files produced by BATS tests are *ephemeral* in temporary directories.

But, tests can "save out" files to the *WCT test data repository* located at:

#+begin_example
build/tests/input/<dirs>/<files>
build/tests/<category>/<version>/<test-name>/<files>
#+end_example

- The ~/input/~ provides a few data files purely for consumption.
- The ~/<category>/~ names intention, eg *plots*, *history*, *reports*.
- The ~<version>~ is that of the software producing the files (Waf variable ~VERSION~).
- ~./wcb packrepo~ packs repo to tar files.  ~./wcb --tests~ installs them.
  - for now, remote repo lives [[https://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/tmp/wcttest/data_repo/][here]] and is manually populated from repo packs.

* Saving files to test data repo from BATS

*The repo is not a dumping ground!*

Only "save out" files with clear intention how they will be used longer term.

A "save out" is done with WCT's ~wct-bats.sh~ library function ~saveout~:

#+begin_example
@test "some history test" {
  # make somefile.npz here....
  saveout -c history somefile.npz
}
@test "some plotting test" {
  # make someplot.png here....
  saveout -c plots someplot.png
}
#+end_example

* Test data repository categories

- input :: created by hand with special input data files (depos, frames, etc).
- plots :: for saving data visualizations in PNG, PDF format.
- history :: for select data files output from each software version.
- report :: collecting from *plots* and processing from *history* to produce files for human inspection (ie, web pages) that cover multiple software versions.

* (Re)Making history

New tests are invented and we want to run them against old WCT software.

#+begin_example
./test/scripts/multi-release-testing \
   ~/wct/releases/rel{21,22,23,24} \
   ~/wct/development/master ~/wct/development/0.24.x
#+end_example

- Runs tests and place all ~saveout~ results in the *current release area*.
- Runs tests in 4 named releases, 2 development areas, *per-release parallelism*.
- Requires an ~.envrc~ file exists and manages each areas environment.
- Runs only the tests with a tag of ~history~.

* History is a work in progress

Largely needs to be done by an "expert"
- Some old code can not be run by new tests.
  - We define suitable old versions in Waf env var ~TEST_DATA_VERSIONS~.
- Requires many software release environments, each managed with [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]].
- Manual ~packrepo~ of results and upload to my web area.
